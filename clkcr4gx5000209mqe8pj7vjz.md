## Introduction

Hackathons offer a unique opportunity for programmers to learn, collaborate, and network with like-minded individuals. In this blog, I will recount my memorable first hackathon experience at the Mavericks Designathon organized by Hexaware Technologies. This exhilarating event allowed us to design and develop an application using frontend frameworks and harness the power of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Github Copilot. Our team, Controlled Freaks, took on the challenge of creating an Employee Referral System, and the experience was nothing short of incredible. 🚀🎉

## Formation

As a fresher at Hexaware Technologies, I was eager to participate in the Mavericks Designathon. Alongside three of my friends, we formed the team Controlled Freaks and decided to work on the Employee Referral System application. Before the hackathon, we meticulously prepared UI designs using Figma and created a sample backend server with Strapi. With roles assigned, we were ready for the 20-hour-long hackathon event. 👩‍💻👨‍💻

## The Hackathon Experience

The Designathon started with a warm welcome and goodies for all participants. The organizers took care of our needs, ensuring we had a comfortable environment to work in. Our tech stack included React with TypeScript for the front end, Material UI for the component library, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, and Strapi for the backend. We relied heavily on GitHub Copilot and Chat GPT to streamline our development process, and their performance was impressive despite some minor hiccups. 💡💻

## The Final Demo

After an intense 20 hours of coding fueled by coffee ☕, it was time for the final demo. With PPTs and speeches prepared, we showcased our application to the panel members. Though confident in the technical aspects, I realized the importance of improving my presentation skills. Nevertheless, the demo went well, and the adrenaline rush that followed was indescribable. The experience left me eager to participate in more hackathons in the future. 🏆🎤

## The Results

Two days later, the presentation ceremony took place with the organization's leaders as chief guests. The tension was palpable as we awaited the results. When they announced us as the winners, it was an overwhelming moment of bliss. Collecting the prize, posing for photos, and delivering the winning speech filled us with pride and motivation. This victory provided a significant boost, encouraging me to participate in more events and leverage my programming skills further. 🎊🥳

## Conclusion

Participating in the Mavericks Designathon was an unforgettable experience. The journey of teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving culminated in a victory that left a lasting impact. The hackathon reinforced my passion for programming and ignited a desire to explore more opportunities for learning and growth. I look forward to future hackathons, where I can continue to push my limits and celebrate the joy of innovation and collaboration. 🤩🚀
