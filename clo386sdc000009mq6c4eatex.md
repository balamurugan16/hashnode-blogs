📣 Hey everyone! I came across some interesting advice on the internet a few months back, and I've been trying to follow it ever since. Today, I want to share it with all of you. The advice is simple: **"Don't be a Frameworker, Be an Engineer."** 🛠️👩‍💻

But what does that really mean? Let me explain using my own experience. In my day job, I work with JavaScript frameworks like React and NestJS, which is cool. 🚀 However, because I spend most of my time in these frameworks, I started calling myself a "React Developer" on LinkedIn. 📋 But here's the thing: a software engineer should be open to learning and technology as needed. 🌐 It's all about having the right mindset.

There are a couple of reasons why some people get stuck in the "Frameworker" mindset. First, folks don't want to invest time in learning something new when they're already getting the job done with what they know. 🕒 Second, job titles often specify things like "Full Stack Java Developer" or ".Net Developer," which can make you feel locked into a specific technology. 🧱 But remember, the basics of programming are pretty much the same across the board.

Imagine your organization decides to switch from TypeScript to Go for microservices (a great move for better performance). If you have the right mindset, you'd gladly say YES! Learning a new language isn't as hard as you might think. 🧠 The fundamental programming concepts like conditionals, loops, and functions remain constant. Adapting to a new syntax is a piece of 🍰.

If you firmly believe you're only a "React Developer" or an "Angular Developer" and can't step out of that box, well, good luck! 🍀 What if the framework you've mastered becomes obsolete one day? The main goal of a software engineer is to solve problems effectively using the right tools. While React is fantastic for building user interfaces, there are more performance-focused alternatives out there. For instance, when building a blog site, choosing a framework like Astro or Gatsby might make more sense. 🚀📝

I got this amazing advice from a YouTuber named ThePrimeagen, and it's been a game-changer for me. I've started learning Go and coding in it outside of my day job where I mainly use TypeScript. It's a fun and rewarding practice, and I wish I'd understood this mindset earlier in my career. 🚀🧡

So, I encourage all of you to be open to working with any technology and focus on problem-solving rather than getting too attached to a particular language or framework. 🌟🚀
